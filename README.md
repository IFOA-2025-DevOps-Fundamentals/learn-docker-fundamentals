# Docker Fundamentals
A gentle introduction to Docker, containers creation and management, and containerized development.

## Course Goals
The course contained in this repository is meant to provide a basic understanding of Docker principles, how it works, how to create, manage and run containers, and how to develop a container for a personal application. It offers a hands-on experience with Docker commands, Dockerfiles, and container management including also a brief presentation of Docker Compose.
